VZLUSAT has a much more noisy behaviour, and that is not something that reflect the actual link state, but is something that is related to how the signal power is calculated.

My goal is that it should the yellow lines for the whole thing

There are some outliers

More like that the noise power is affected by the clean signal power

There are some weird things

I dont know why this one looks like shit

Finer resolution

Still very very noisy data. I am guessing the only smart solution is making a moving average on the data. Then it will be called the truth that a model will have to predict. It is not completely stupid, but not that sexy.


Checking how the outliers look in the waterfall plot

Only two that are very fucked, and should be discarded


I do not like the noise:

Rectangular window

Hamming windowed moving average
![alt text](screenshots/image-86.png)
larger window
![alt text](screenshots/image-88.png)

time resolution of 0.01 and fft size 256

The red line looks more like a real signal. I am going to make it crazier. it was not that different unfortunately

I reduced the resolution to 128 and time to 0.01

I can now see the noise. And the inteference. How large can the doppler shift be? it is never larger than 50k

FD=(v/c)*f
v=7600km/s max
c=3*10^8 m/s
f=437MHz

Max doppler= 11kHz
sampling rate is 250kHz
fft resolution is obj_act[].noise_obj.fft_size

If max value of the fft in valid range is not 10 times larger than the obj_act.noise, the data is an outlier and should be removed.


The variance cannot directly be used for anything unfortunately. unless maybe no, even normalising is not doing anything....

the noise could probably also be found by a histogram instead of just the average of specific bins

larger

not that much was gained from going to 0.005, but 0.01 and 64 is my recommended value
